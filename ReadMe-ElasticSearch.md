*Steps for installing ElasticSearch in your machine:*

Download ElasticSearch 8.6.0 from https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/zip-windows.html

(If you are having experience in Docker, you can use this docker method: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html)

Extract the elasticsearch-8.6.0.zip file to C:\Program Files  (or any other program folder)

Add following line in config/elasticsearch.yml:

action.auto_create_index: .monitoring*,.watches,.triggered_watches,.watcher-history*,.ml*


Open Windows command prompt
cd "C:\Program Files\elasticsearch-8.6.0"
Install ElasticSearch using following comnmand
C:\Program Files\elasticsearch-8.6.0>.\bin\elasticsearch.bat

Wait for several minutes, You will see some details regarding Username, Password, Access Token.  Copy those credentials and keep in a safe place.
To confirm whether it started or not, open the browser and enter https://localhost:9200/   When it asks for username and password, enter the account details which you copied earlier.
Now, In the browser you will see an output like below
{
  "name" : "ROLO-HOME-LAB",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "rIrrUgewQOeKEM3uz-9kDg",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "8.6.0",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "zip",
    "build_hash" : "f67ef2df40237445caa70e2fef79471cc608d70d",
    "build_date" : "2023-01-04T09:35:21.782467981Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.4.2",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "7.17.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}



Now, come back to command prompt then press Ctrl+C to quit this Service. Becuase we are going to add this ElasticSearch Service under Windows Services (services.msc) 

To install ES as a Service enter following command
C:\NewProgramFiles\elasticsearch-8.6.0>.\bin\elasticsearch-service install

Now Open Windows Services (services.msc) and Start the ElasticSearch Service from that service window.

Again, refresh the same browser (URL: https://localhost:9200/) and confirm if you are seeing the right output in the browser window.

(Note: For Development and Debugging purposes, You can install an Chrome extension called "Multi ElasticSeach Head")
